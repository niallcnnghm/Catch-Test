# Catch-Test

My approach for this test was making notes with what the HTML structure would look like, brief CSS instructions that would make as much of the site as mobile ready as possible. This made my CSS file easier to build and maintain. Each section was drafted out and split up.

I encountered a few problems over the test. Particularly on the first image of the flexbox, I noticed that the white font blended in with the background, I got the image overlay to work better by setting the background colour of the section to black and dropping the opacity of each image to 0.8. It darkened the images but the text was far easier to read. There are some sections of my code when it comes to flex where it works but I'm not sure its best practice.

At the end of the three hour test limit, I found that the click toggle on the mobile design nav bar wasn't working as planned, it may be an issue with the display: none if statement I made on the js file attached.

With more time I would have this issue fixed, tidied the CSS into a SCSS file and got the exact measurements for each font size.
